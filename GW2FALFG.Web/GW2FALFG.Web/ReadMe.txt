This is just a little project requested by my GW2 guild.  I'm more or less duplicating the website GW2LFG.com.  The idea my guild leader had was to essentially offer a LFG service scoped to just our server.  Now frankly, I'm not sure why other than WvW you would want something like that since it limits your options for grouping but nevertheless it was an interesting project to work on.  

It's fairly quick and dirty.  It is an ASP.Net Web API backend using AngularJS for the front end to handle binding and switching between adding a new entry and viewing the list of existing entries.
